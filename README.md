# thesis-title-page-generator

<!--[live demo](https://library.pratt.edu/thesis-title-page-generator)-->

a web-based form that offers an easy selection of
options and text fields to generate a unique set of title
and signature pages for student theses. This form exports
PDFs with proper formatting and information based on
certain conditions. The PDF can then be merged with a
working document.

## How it's built

The form is built using [Bootstrap 5](https://blog.getbootstrap.com/2021/05/05/bootstrap-5/) for layout and [jsPDF](https://github.com/parallax/jsPDF) for generating the PDF.
